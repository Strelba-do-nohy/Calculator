Profiling report:
As we can see from the output, due to the fact that we have combined the execution of simple functions into several 
long lines, the program practically does not lose speed with an increase in the number of input data.
The execution time for the largest number of input data (1000 characters) does not exceed 0.006 seconds.
In fact, the program does not linger at any of the stages of execution.
