3. Our Communication:
 
 - We have created a chat in Telegram, where we solve frivolous (minor) problems,
 ask questions and control the activity of completing tasks.
 - We also organized a Discord group where we call up at least once a week, check
 the work, give comments on the work of teammates and solve serious problems that
 cannot be solved by one team member.
 - Also in Discord, we confer and carry out common tasks.
 - And finally, we created a channel in the github, where we outlined our plan
 and deadlines, and where we post the finished parts of the project so that each
 team member can rely on the work of a teammate.

4. Choosing a programming environment and git:
 -Programming environment: Visual Studio Code (Language: Python)
 -Git: github
 -Hosting: https://github.com/.
 - Our repository is https://github.com/Strelba-do-nohy 
 -We have also added user with email ivs.kontrola@gmail.com to the repository as
colleague so that this user can check out this store after receiving the file
invitation.
