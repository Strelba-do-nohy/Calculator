Unrealistic deadlines 
  When setting deadlines we didn't take into considiration terms of exams and other projects.
Inefficient task distribution 
  We didn't analyze project structure well enough, so we distributed tasks between team members in a way, that for example for mockup was responsible person who didn't make gui so we had to swap roles.
Miscommunication
  We should have conducted meeting more often than we did, that's why in some cases we faced minor problems in implementaio.
